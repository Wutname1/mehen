# Emit a structured changelog for one release as JSON on stdout:
#   { product, version, released_at, download_url, items:[{section,text,tags[]}] }
#
# Each commit subject in the release range becomes one item. The section is
# derived from the commit-prefix convention (new:/fixes:/improved:). Tags carry
# ONLY what the author wrote explicitly as [tag] / #tag markers - all
# content-based auto-tagging is done server-side on the website so the rules
# live in one place. Markers are read from BOTH the subject and the body, so a
# user-facing subject can stay clean while the body carries the tags. The verb
# prefix and any trailing subject markers are stripped from the displayed text.
#
# Platform tags (windows/linux/macos and their aliases) are normalized to a
# canonical slug and kept in the same tags array - they are what lets a reader
# tell an OS-specific change from a shared one. render-changelog.sh reads them
# back out to group each section into Windows / Linux / macOS / All platforms.
#
# Env:
#   PRODUCT          product key stored on the website (default Mehen)
#   RELEASE_VERSION  version string (preferred; the workflow computes it once so
#                    the built app and the changelog agree). Falls back to
#                    GITHUB_REF_NAME with a leading v stripped.
#   DOWNLOAD_URL     optional download link
#   GITHUB_REF_NAME  tag name on a tag push (e.g. 1.2.3)

# Body markers exist so the subject can stay clean user-facing prose while the
# commit still carries its tags - that is the documented convention in AGENTS.md.
# A whole line of nothing but tags is the normal way to write them, so lines are
# never filtered wholesale; the marker pattern itself does the work:
#   - a marker must contain a letter, so issue refs and prose numbers
#     ("Rule #2", "closes #481") never become tags
#   - a `#tag` must start a word, so `#[cfg(...)]` and mid-word hashes are out
#   - lines opening a comment are skipped, so a pasted `// #foo`, `-- #foo` or
#     `# note #foo` snippet does not mint a tag. A line that STARTS with a tag
#     (`#linux`, no space after the hash) is not a comment and is kept - that
#     is the normal way to write a tag-only line.
