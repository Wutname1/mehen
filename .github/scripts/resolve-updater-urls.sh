# returns asset metadata as JSON rather than the installer -- so the updater hands
# NSIS a JSON blob, which tears down the existing install and leaves nothing behind.

# Runs in two modes because a draft release does not serve its assets from the
# public download path -- that path 404s until the release is published:
#
#   rewrite <tag>   Rewrite the URLs and re-upload. Run BEFORE publishing, so the
#                   manifest is already correct the moment the release goes live.
#   verify  <tag>   HEAD every URL and fail if any is not a plausible installer.
#                   Run AFTER publishing, when the URLs actually resolve.
